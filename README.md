## Features

The lodash string functions implimented in this extension are:
- camelCase

- lowerCase
- lowerFirst
- parseInt
- snakeCase
- startCase
- toLower
- toUpper
- trim
- trimEnd
- trimStart

Simply highlight the text you wish to convert, press shift + cmd + p, type the name of the command you wish to use, and press enter.

## Extension Settings

This extension does not currently take any settings. Simply install it, and it works.
